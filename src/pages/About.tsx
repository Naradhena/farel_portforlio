      <p>
      Hi, I'm Farel! I'm a student at SMKN 1 Banjar with a strong passion for information technology. Currently, I'm an active member of the student council (OSIS) in the IT department, where I help manage various tech-related activities at school.

I have a growing interest in programming and web development, and Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge in coding and web design. I enjoy working collaboratively and love taking on new challenges in the tech world.
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of technology, I like spending my free time playing games and keeping up with the latest digital trends. I believe technology can be a powerful tool to solve problems and bring positive change to society.
